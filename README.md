# UNIVERSITY-ADMISSION-BOT
Smart Admission Recommendation Engine
The Smart Admission Recommendation Engine is a unique enhancement that transforms the University Admissions Bot from a simple question–answer system into an intelligent virtual admission counselor.

Feature Description

Best-fit courses based on the student profile
