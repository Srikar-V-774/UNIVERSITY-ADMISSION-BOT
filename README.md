# UNIVERSITY-ADMISSION-BOT
I’ve created a comprehensive, professional README for your University Admissions Bot in the canvas.
This README is:
- Project-report ready (great for internal assessment / mini-project / final-year project)
- Structured like real GitHub open-source documentation
- Easy to customize (tech stack, your name, college, etc.)
What you can do next
Tell me which technology you’re actually using (Python + Flask, Java, MERN, etc.) and I’ll tailor the README exactly to that.
If this is for college submission, I can:
Align it with IEEE / academic project format
Add problem statement, scope, limitations
Convert it into a project report (DOC/PDF) style
Want a flowchart, architecture diagram, or use-case diagram? I can design those too.
